This project was done as part of course work in the final year of my undergraduate study.

Summary of the project:

The main motive of this project is to show a difference between both proactive and reactive routing protocols of Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET). These protocols have a wide area of applications in Wireless Sensor Networks which are helpful in traversing in different networkin systems.

In proactive routing protocols every node maintains one (or) more tables representing the entire topology of the network and traverse to the destination node whereas the reactive routing protocols are used to setup routes on demand to traverse to the desired destination node. The performance analysis for these protocols are compared between Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) Protocols.

The measurements for these protocols can be analysed through a varied set of parameters such as Simulation Time, number of sinks, packets received, end to end delay and throughput. Then this project draws a consclusion about in which conditions to prefer proactive and reactive routing protocols accordingly. To visualzie all these operations this project uses a tool to simulate the protocols which is known as a Network Simulator (NS3) which handles working of different networking protocols.

Software Requirements:

i) Operating System Used: Ubuntu 16.04

ii) Programming Languages: C++

iii) Other Software: Network Simulator Version-3 (NS3), VMWare 12.0, Trace Metrics, Python Visualizer, Text Editor as IDE in Ubuntu

"Project Report.pdf" : This file navigates through different stages in the development of the project and also gives a clear outline on how we had brought our assumptions on different parameters while performing a comparison between the proactive and the reactive protocols. This report also gives an explanation on how to use the Trace Metrics and Python Visualizer tools for the NS3 MANET routing protocols and estimate their associated parametric values.

In the Appendix attached at the end of the report there is the source code for both the routing protocols which we had developed and made the necessary changes to the code which was inherited from the NS3 website.

"IJR Published Paper.pdf" : This is a supportive document where we were requested by the undergraduate university to publish a research paper as there were good end results and findings obtained on the analysis performed as a comparison between the two MANET routing protocols.
